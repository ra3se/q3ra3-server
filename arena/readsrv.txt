Threshold is the (damage * 100 / time) difference between teams that has to be reached before
teams are balanced. If SUM_red(damage * 100 / time) - SUM_blue(damage * 100 / time) > threshold then balance.

g_rotateLogs 1/0

"seconds": in within time you can type XX "lines"
"limit": is how many times you can trigger the flood protection before being kicked

g_voteInterval [seconds]
Minimum of seconds between allowed callvote command
"seconds": how many seconds between two callvotes we allow. 
Eg. if you set it to "60" players cant callvote before 60 seconds has passed before last callvote.

--------------------------------------
 Installation
--------------------------------------
This is the server package for Rocket Arena 3. You will also need the client
package (a seperate download) installed on the server. Download it and install
according to the included instructions.

Extract all files to your \quake3\arena directory

Customize the server.cfg to your tastes. It includes the adminpass (see below)
which will allow for in-game configuration of the mod. Please change this
password!

Please see below for info on the arena.cfg file, used to customize settings
on a per server/per level/per arena basis. 
It includes map rotation information as well.

The "ra3_server.bat" file ("ra3_server.sh" for Unix) has a sample command line for
starting an RA3 server. Note that:
1. You must set "+set fs_game arena" on the command line
2. You must set "+set bot_enable 0" on the command line
3. You must set +set vm_game 0" on the command line

--------------------------------------
 Startup commands
--------------------------------------
Startup commandline example:

Windows:
"quake3.exe +set fs_game arena +set vm_game 0 +set sv_pure 1 +set bot_enable 0 +set dedicated 2 +set net_port 27960 +exec server.cfg"

Sample batfile for Windows is in the file ra316sv.zip, called "ra3_server.bat".

Unix:
"./q3ded +set fs_game arena +set vm_game 0 +set sv_pure 1 +set bot_enable 0 +set dedicated 2 +set net_port 27960 +exec server.cfg"

Sample shellscript for Linux is in the file ra316sv.zip, called "ra3_server.sh".

Use "+set dedicated 0" to run a Listen server (you play on the same machine) not recommended!
Use "+set dedicated 1" to run a private dedicated server
Use "+set dedicated 2" to run a public dedicated server

For info how-to configure your RA3 server with punkbuster support, please see http://www.punkbuster.com/

--------------------------
 Administration / Mod setup
--------------------------
There are several console variables which control how the mod functions.
Most other options have been moved to the arena.cfg file.

"set g_adminpass mypassword" is the password that you set to allow in-game
administration of the server.

"set arenacfg myarena.cfg" will allow you to use filenames other than arena.cfg 
(to run two different servers on the same install for example).

"set location <locationcode>" will allow players to find servers by region, a list
of region locationcodes is in the sample server.cfg

"set rconPassword mypassword" sets the standard Q3 remote console password. You can use
this password with the "rcon" command to control the server remotely.

--------------------------------------
 server.cfg file
--------------------------------------
See file server.cfg in ra316sv.zip for example configuration

--------------
 arena.cfg file
--------------
The arena.cfg file allows you to specify map options on a:
1. per server
2. per map
3. per arena
basis
Information is stored in a hierarchical format. Priority goes in order to:
1. Values for the specific arena
2. Values for that map
3. Global values defined at the top of the arena.cfg file
4. Default values stored in the game code.

The format of the file is (note that the < > characters are not typed!):
<global default option>;
<global default option>;
<mapname> {
//comment
	<map default option>;
	<map default option>;
	<map default option>;
	<arena number> {
			<arena default option>;
			<arena default option>;
			<arena default option>;
	}
	<arena number> {
			<arena default option>;
	}
}

For example:
//-----------START OF FILE------------
maploop: ra3map1 ra3map3 ra3map5 q3dm6; // <-- sets the map rotation for the server
allowvotinggrapple:1; // <-- allows people to vote for grapple on this map

		armor: 200; //<-- default health if none is specified
		health: 100; //<-- default armor
	1 {
		weapons: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; //<-- arena 1 takes out the plasma
		armor: 100;  //<-- reduces default armor to 100

	}

	}

	}
	4 {
		health: 500; //<-- start with a ton of health
		armor: 500; //<-- and lots of armor
		slugs: 999; //<-- starting slugs is 999 now
	}
//you do not need to list all the maps/arenas, unlisted ones will use defaults

Please take a look at the included arena.cfg for some more examples.
If your settings are not being used, please make sure that:
1. you have a ":" (colon) seperating the identifier and the value
2. you have a ";" (semi-colon) at the end each line

------------
 Game Types
------------
Rocket Arena 3 has 4 different types of games that can go on in the arenas:
"rocketarena" - 1v1/2v2/3v3 line-based gameplay
"clanarena" - 2 teams of unlimited size, no line
"redrover" - 2 teams, players switch between them when they die
"practice" - No teams, no deaths, just carnage
See the client readme for longer descriptions of each game type.

The gametype for each arena is specified by the "gametype" value in the arena.cfg.
If no gametype is specified, the default of "rocketarena" will be used. 
If the gametype is specified as "pickup" then the game type defined at the top of the file
as "defpickup" will be used. By default almost all of the RA3 maps are set up with one arena as
pickup, and the defpickup value as "clanarena". So if you want to switch your whole server over
to redrover, you just need to change the "defpickup" value.

----------------------
 In Game Administration
----------------------
To use the in game administration, press esc and go to the in-game options menu.
There is a menu item for "admin". To admin a specific arena, type in your password and
double click on the arena name. It will then let you change all the settings for that arena.

To change maps, just type in the password and double click a map in the list.

-------------------
 Troubleshooting/FAQ
-------------------

Q: It asks for a CD when the server starts up?
or
Q: It won't load any maps?

A: Make sure you have +bot_enable 0 on the command line. RA3 does not support Q3 bots yet.


Q: How do I change the map loop or add another map?

A: Edit the maploop line of arena.cfg (see below for more info)


Q: Can I run custom or regular Q3 maps with RA3?

A: Yes, just add them to your map loop (see below)


Q: When I start a server or load a map it doesn't work, or it gives me an out
of memory error?

A: Make sure your "com_hunkmegs" setting is at least 64


Q: I get an error like "Error reading config file: unbalanced {}" when running a server?

A: You made a mistake while editing arena.cfg - restore the original file from the zip.
